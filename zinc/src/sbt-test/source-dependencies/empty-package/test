# We usually call `compile` right before a checkDependencies call
# However, as per https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/1287#issue-2010864729
# The check would be too late to catch the missing dependency between a.Use and pkgName.Test
# As invalidateInitial introduces library dependency between a.Use and pkgName.Test
